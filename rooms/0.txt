You don't know how much time has passed. Slowly, you regain your senses.
You find yourself in complete darkness, except for a dim light
coming from somewhere illuminating your surroundings.
As your eyes slowly adjust to the dark, you find yourself in a cave.
A mysterious light is coming from east.%

#x+cave
In the faint light,you could make out that the walls of
the cave depict ancient paintings.%

#x+light
The light is of bluish white,as there is only a dead end behind you,
the only other option is to follow the light.%

#x+paintings
The paintings show of great wars, grandoise kings and revolting peasants.%
