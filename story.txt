 You don't know how much time has passed. Slowly, you regain your senses.
You find yourself in complete darkness, except for a dim light
coming from somewhere illuminating your surroundings.
As your eyes slowly adjust to the dark, you find yourself in a cave.
A mysterious light is coming from somewhere in front of you.%
